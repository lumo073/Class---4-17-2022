    Let Me tell you Few things about her, She is not my own blood Sister but for me, More than a Mother and Sister.
    She is very Good Person. She was the one who raised me and care me give me love and teach me many things about
    this world . I always admire her. She help me in need and also in many ways. I am very proud and Happy to have
    a Mother and Sister like her. Sometimes everyone goes through many difficulties and Many problem but she teach 
    me that "We face many problem and difficulties without them our life and structure is not complete". We face 
    many things but we should try to fight and go ahead which is her best and plus point . She is right about that
    we all get problems and many things comes but if we stay and look into it there is nothing we can do , so we
    should get through it and Fight for that and We will get Victory Over it.
